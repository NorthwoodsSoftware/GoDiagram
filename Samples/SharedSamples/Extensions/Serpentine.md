This sample demonstrates a custom Layout, [SerpentineLayout], which assumes the graph consists of a chain of nodes.
The layout is defined in its own file, as [SerpentineLayout.cs](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoDiagram/blob/main/Extensions/Layouts/Serpentine/SerpentineLayout.cs).

It also has [Layout.IsViewportSized] set to true, so that resizing the Diagram will automatically re-layout.
