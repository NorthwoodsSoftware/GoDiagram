Selecting a node will show a rescaling handle that when dragged will modify the node's [GraphObject.Scale] property.

Just as the [ResizingTool] changes the [GraphObject.DesiredSize] of an object,
and just as the [RotatingTool] changes the [GraphObject.Angle] of an object,
the [RescalingTool] changes the [GraphObject.Scale] of an object.
