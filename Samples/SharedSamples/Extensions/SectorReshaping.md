Two of the handles permit changing the angles of the sector; one handle permits changing the radius of the sector.

Note that the [Geometry] returned by `MakeSector` always returns a Geometry that
occupies the area that would be occupied by a full circle. That Geometry-creating function also
depends on three data properties, `Radius`, `Angle`, and `Sweep`.
