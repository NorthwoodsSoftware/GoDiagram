A [BalloonLink] is a custom [Link] that draws a "balloon" shape around the Link.FromNode.
It will create a triangular shape with the base at the FromNode and the other point at the ToNode.
It is defined in its own file, as [BalloonLink.cs](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoDiagram/blob/main/Extensions/GraphObjects/BalloonLink/BalloonLink.cs).

Usage can also be seen in the [Comments](demo/Comments) sample.
