This sample demonstrates the [OrthogonalLinkReshapingTool] that is defined in its own file,
as [OrthogonalLinkReshapingTool.cs](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoDiagram/blob/main/Extensions/Tools/OrthogonalLinkReshaping/OrthogonalLinkReshapingTool.cs).
This tool allow users to shift the sections of orthogonal links in addition to resegmenting them.
The Diagram's [ToolManager.LinkReshapingTool] and link template's [Part.Reshapable] properties must be set to use this tool.
The [Link.Resegmentable] property can still optionally be used.
