This custom [DraggingTool] class makes guidelines visible as a Part is dragged around a Diagram and is nearly aligned with another Part.
If a LocationElementName is set, then this aligns [Part.LocationElement]s instead.
The tool is defined in its own file, as [GuidedDraggingTool.cs](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoDiagram/blob/main/Extensions/Tools/GuidedDragging/GuidedDraggingTool.cs).
