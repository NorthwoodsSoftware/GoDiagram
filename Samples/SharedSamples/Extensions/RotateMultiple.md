This sample demonstrates a custom [RotatingTool] which allows the user to rotate many selected objects at once.
It is defined in its own file, as [RotateMultipleTool.cs](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoDiagram/blob/main/Extensions/Tools/RotateMultiple/RotateMultipleTool.cs).

Hold down the control key in order to rotate each selected node individually, rather than all of them collectively.
