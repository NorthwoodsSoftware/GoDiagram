To simulate mouse events the buttons below use the [Robot] class that is defined in [Robot.cs](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoDiagram/blob/main/Extensions/Input/Robot/Robot.cs).

The [UndoManager] has been enabled in the main Diagram.
Give focus to the Diagram and you can undo everything and then redo
everything to confirm what was executed by the Robot.
