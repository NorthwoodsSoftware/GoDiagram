The [GeometryReshapingTool] class allows for a Shape's Geometry to be modified by the user via the dragging of tool handles.
Reshape handles are drawn as Adornments at each point in the geometry.
It is defined in its own file, as [GeometryReshapingTool.cs](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoDiagram/blob/main/Extensions/Tools/GeometryReshaping/GeometryReshapingTool.cs).

Usage can also be seen in the [Freehand Drawing](demo/FreehandDrawing)
and [Polygon Drawing](demo/PolygonDrawing) samples.
