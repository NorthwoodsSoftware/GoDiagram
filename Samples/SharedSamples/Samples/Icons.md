This sample shows several "icons" that were originally SVG paths, used as Shapes in GoDiagram.

Above some icons are shown in a tree-like Diagram, below a larger selection is shown.

You can easily add your own shapes to GoDiagram by writing your own geometry strings, or by copying SVG path strings, as is done in this sample.
[Read more about GoDiagram path syntax here](intro/geometry.html).

The icons in this sample are from a selection of free icons at [icomooon.io](https://icomoon.io).
