This isn't a truly *minimal* demonstration of **GoDiagram**,
because we do specify a custom Node template, but it's pretty simple.
The whole source for the sample is shown below if you click on the link.

This sample sets the [Diagram.NodeTemplate], with a [Node] template that data binds both the text string and the shape's fill color.
For an overview of building your own templates and model data, see the [Getting Started tutorial](learn/index.html).

Using the mouse and common keyboard commands, you can pan, select, move, copy, delete, and undo/redo.
On touch devices, use your finger to act as the mouse, and hold your finger stationary to bring up a context menu.
The default context menu supports most of the standard commands that
are enabled at that time for the selected object.

For a more elaborate and capable sample, see the [Basic](demo/Basic) sample.
