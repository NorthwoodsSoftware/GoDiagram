This sample displays all predefined GoDiagram arrowheads.
Select or hover over a Node or its Link to see the names of the arrowheads on the Link.

Each Link shows two arrowheads.
The Link template has a Shape whose [Shape.ToArrow] property is bound to an arrowhead name.
A different Shape in the template has its [Shape.FromArrow] property bound to a different arrowhead name.
Each arrowhead has been scaled up to make it more easily visible.

See the definitions of all these arrowheads in the file:
[Arrowheads.cs](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoDiagram/blob/main/Extensions/GraphObjects/Arrowheads/Arrowheads.cs).

For predefined shape geometries, see the [Shapes](demo/Shapes) sample.
