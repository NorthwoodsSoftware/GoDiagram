This sample shows an organizational chart diagram and uses an in-laid GoDiagram [Overview] to aid the user in navigation.
The diagram uses a [TreeLayout] featuring [TreeStyle.LastParents] to allow for different alignments on the last parents.
The data was taken from the UN web site in August 2009.

A search box demonstrates one way of finding and highlighting nodes whose data includes particular strings.
Note that one can see all of the highlighted nodes in the Overview.

To learn how to build an org chart from scratch with GoDiagram, see the [Getting Started tutorial](learn/index.html).

If you want to have some "assistant" nodes on the side, above the regular reports,
see the [Org Chart Assistants](demo/OrgChartAssistants) sample, which is a copy of this sample
that uses a custom [TreeLayout] to position "assistants" that way.
