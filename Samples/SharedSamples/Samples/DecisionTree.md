This sample allows a user to make progressive decisions about personality types.

There are two kinds of nodes, so there are two node templates ("decision" and "personality")
that determine the appearance and behavior of each [Node].

The "decision" template displays the abbreviated personality type and two choice buttons, all surrounded by a figure.
Clicking a button will either expand the choice or will collapse all nodes leading from that choice.

The "personality" template displays the personality descriptions, as the "leaf" nodes for the tree.
