The FlowChart sample demonstrates several key features of GoDiagram,
namely [Palette](intro/palette.html)s,
[Linkable nodes](intro/links.html), Drag/Drop behavior,
[Text Editing](intro/textBlocks.html), and the use of
[Node Template Maps](intro/templateMaps.html) in Diagrams.

Mouse-over a Node to view its ports.
Drag from these ports to create new Links.
Selecting Links allows you to re-shape and re-link them.
Selecting a Node and then clicking its TextBlock will allow
you to edit text (except on the Start and End Nodes).
