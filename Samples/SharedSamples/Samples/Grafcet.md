A grafcet diagram is similar to a [sequential function chart](demo/SequentialFunction).

Select a Node to show a list of Buttons that enable creating new Nodes or drawing new Links.
These buttons are defined as an adornment that is used in a common [Part.SelectionAdornmentTemplate].
This diagram uses many custom functions, including an overridden [LinkingTool] and a special
Link class, **BarLink**.
