A *planogram* is a visual representation of a store's products or services, often used as a tool to maximize sales.

Drag-and-drop "items" from the Palette onto "racks" in the Diagram.
"Items" are implemented as Nodes; "racks" are implemented as Groups.
Once items have been placed on a rack, they can be resized, if necessary.
The [DraggingTool.IsGridSnapEnabled] and [ResizingTool.IsGridSnapEnabled] are both set
to true to allow for snapping to the background grid.
Node and Group templates both use dragging functions to allow for highlighting so the user knows which
rack an item will belong to.
