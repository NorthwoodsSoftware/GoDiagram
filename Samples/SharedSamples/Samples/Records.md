This record mapper shows a number of "fields" for each "record" and how they are mapped between each other.

Draw new links by dragging from the background of any field.
Reconnect a selected link by dragging its diamond-shaped handle.
The "record" Nodes use a [PanelLayoutTable] to place the various fields into rows.
Records are not copyable or deletable.

For a variation on this sample with selectable fields in the record nodes, see the [selectable fields](demo/SelectableFields) sample.
