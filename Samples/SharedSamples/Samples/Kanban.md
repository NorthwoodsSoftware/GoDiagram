A Kanban board is a work and workflow visualization used to communicate the status and progress of work items. Click on the color of a note to cycle through colors.

This design and implementation were adapted from the [Swim Lanes (vertical)](demo/SwimLanesVertical) sample.
Unlike that sample:
  + there are no Links
  + lanes cannot be nested into "pools"
  + lanes cannot be resized
  + the user cannot drop tasks into the diagram's background
  + all tasks are ordered within a single column; the user can rearrange the order
  + tasks can freely be moved into other lanes 
  + lanes are not movable or copyable or deletable
