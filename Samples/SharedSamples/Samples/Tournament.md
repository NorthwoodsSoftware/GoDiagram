Click on the empty score boxes next to names to fill in scores for each player.
The scores must be non-negative numbers with at most 3 digits. Scores are validated using a [TextEditingTool.TextValidation] function.
When two players in a "game" have a score, one of them will automatically advance to the next round of the bracket.
