An **IVR tree**, or Interactive Voice Response Tree, is typically used by
automated answering systems to direct calls to the correct party. This particular example
is for a car dealership to route calls.

This Interactive Voice Response Tree (IVR tree) has nodes that contain a collapsible list of actions, controlled by a **PanelExpanderButton**,
with a **TreeExpanderButton** underneath the body. See the [Intro page on Buttons](intro/buttons.html) for more GoDiagram button information.
