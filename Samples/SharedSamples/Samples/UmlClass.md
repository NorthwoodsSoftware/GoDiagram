This sample demonstrates one way of defining a UML (Unified Modeling Language) Class Diagram.
Note the use of a separate Panel for the properties and one for the methods,
allowing for an item template for properties and a separate item template for methods.
[PanelExpanderButton](intro/buttons.html#panelExpanderButton)s are used to hide/show class properties and methods.
        
In this example, symbol prefixes indicate the visibility of methods and properties.
The three possibilities are:
  + "+" (Public)
  + "-" (Private)
  + "#" (Protected)

Additionally, the "~" symbol is used to indicate an item is a package.
